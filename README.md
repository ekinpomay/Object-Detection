# Object-Detection

Creating a new product that detects balloons and happy faces, a smart robot for children reacting to
its environment.

The goal of our project is the following,</br>
  </br> • Build a model to</br>
     detect balloons and count the number of balloons.</br>
     detect happy faces.</br>
   </br>• Build a Flask App to upload a picture and receive the same image with</br>
     a text stating the number of balloon(s) and happy face(s) presenting in the photo</br>
     a copy of the uploaded image is saved.</br>
     a copy of the result image with bounding box(es) around the balloon(s) and happy face(s) is saved.</br>
</br> The project was divided into 3 distinct phases:</br>
 </br>  • Phase 1 - Data collection and labeling</br>
   • Phase 2 - Model development</br>
   • Phase 3 - Deployment</br>
